Self-learning how to create and deploy a React portfolio

I've spent a lot of time on Stack Overflow, looking through other's GitHub portfolio website - like this amazing <a href="https://brittanychiang.com/">one<a/> - and realized that the code in mine is very mediciore. Also, there are plenty of limitations and set up issues that come with hosting on GitHub pages. As such, I will be scraping all the work I did on here to make a new website.

## Portfolio

You can view my portfolio via navigating to my <a href="https://kaifsindhi.com/">website</a> or typing <i>npm start</i> in the root of this project's directory. It is currently not very impressive but I am working on it!

### Technologies

</ul>
